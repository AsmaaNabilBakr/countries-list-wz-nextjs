#REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This project Deployed on: https://world-countries-kappa.vercel.app/
## The challenge

integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Please use [React](https://reactjs.org) JavaScript framework/library or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page (Country details page)
- Click back button to return to countries page from the details page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Where to find everything

build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.
you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There are no assets for this task, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
